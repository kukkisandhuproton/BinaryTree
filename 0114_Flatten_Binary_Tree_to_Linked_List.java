/**
Take a stack and push the root node to it.

Set a while loop till the stack is non-empty.

In every iteration, take the node at the top of the stack( say cur) and pop the stack.

If cur has a right child, push it to the stack.

If cur has a left child, push it to the stack.

Set the right child of cur to node at stackâ€™s top.

Set the left child of cur as NULL.
